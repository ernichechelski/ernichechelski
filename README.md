# [Hello there](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/947/998/a66.jpg) 👋

I'm Senior iOS developer with 4 years of experience.

What I like the most in this job is possibility to create scalable, easy to maintain codebases which supports simultaneous work for as many developers as possible. Currently I know how to do so for 5-6 devs, but I'm researching the modular development which should support far more devs at once. 
Clean scalable codebase means that app architecture should not be afraid of every suprising client change 😃

Projects, which I used to work in:
- Async transmission to/from external device via bluetooth for automotive market.
- Started from the very beggining complex app that supports thousands of shop owners in Poland as their main tool. 🇵🇱 
- Couple of fintech apps for very different markets Europe, USA, Africa. 🌎
 
## What's next? 🤔

I plan to update this profile with all knowledge which I have gained during my 4 year journey as iOS Developer. 😄

For now I just placed here my todo list which directly reflects my aspirations for this space 😌

CV stuff 🤪:
- ⏳ The project for iOS UIKit Good Practices. Collection of ideas which I use as iOS Developer. 
- ⏳ The project for iOS SwiftUI Good Practices. Collection of ideas which I use as iOS Developer.

I love to publish a [blogpost](https://ernichechelski.github.io/Blog/)/book with those someday 😍 Working on it 💪

Ideas 💡:
- ⏳ The OTRN (Outrun) Follow to sync cars groups within journey. 
- ⏳ The OTRN (Outrun) Parking to allow anymous communication with car owners.
- ⏳ Messenger app with fully encrypted communication.
- ⏳ Story. Interactive book where the user can change the story.
